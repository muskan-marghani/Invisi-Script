# Invisi-Script
InvisiScript lets you write or draw in the air using simple hand gestures. Raise your index finger to draw, index and middle fingers to move, thumbs-up to clear, and pinky to save. It uses tools like OpenCV and EasyOCR to convert your writing into editable digital text, making it ideal for learning, creativity, and real-time text creation.
